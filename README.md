# Implementation of GoF design patterns in Scala

The idea comes from a [talk by Remi Forax](https://github.com/forax/design-pattern-reloaded/), and I can't resist to implement this in Scala.

GoF patterns are still up to date with Scala, but may be coded in a more straightforward way. 
SOLID principles apply also.

The code is less verbose, because we benefit from language features such as **first-class functions**, **type alias**.

## Abstract Factory

## Logger
For me, it's a kind of Decorator

## Adapter
curryfication

## Observer
lambda with mutable local var

## Visitor
partial function
